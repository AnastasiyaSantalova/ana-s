        description: "An Angular app that lets you dive into the magical world of Hogwarts. Browse spells, ingredients, and houses with powerful filters, infinite scroll, and Material UI polish. The coolest part? Dynamic themes inspired by the four Hogwarts houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin—each with their own colors and vibes. Built with Firebase, a dash of TypeScript, and just enough magic. Mischief managed.",
